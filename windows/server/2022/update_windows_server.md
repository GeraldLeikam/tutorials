# Guide -> Windows Server 2022 - Update Windows Server.
## Guide Overview.

## Special Pro Tipp:
Get yourself a big cup of coffee. The update will take some time.
## Step1: Go to update service.
Click on the search bar in your taskbar and type update. You should find the Update menu in the Startmenu.
Click on this to access the update service.

## Step4: (Optional) Restart if required.
Some updates require a restart of the server. Wait until all other updates are downloaded and installed, then click on "Restart now" and wait for the server restart.

After the restart, go back to the update service and click again on "Check for Updates". This check can also take several minutes. After the second search, you should see a "You're up to date" message. If not, likely required updates will still be downloaded and installed.

## Step5: Finish Update.
If a "You're up to date" message appears now, all updates are completed and your server is up to date.
